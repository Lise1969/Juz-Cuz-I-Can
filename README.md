# Juz-Cuz-I-Can-
Changing the negative connections to words describing Women who are strong.
How many times has societies structure of demigraphics influenced social, personal, or work relationships? When is the time to step-up and step out? I was raised the Ol' Skol way, by grandparnets who where the prodicual of Slave owners in the South. Self-respect and the respect of others was a must. I was raised to believe I am a commodity, not an employee. As a woman, a woman of color, a daughter, mother, and a child of the Most High, I was taught my worth. So the name JUZ CUZ I CAN!, allows me to showcase I have no boundries, or limitations, society cant hold me back or down. What I allow in my life or dont, is one of the two choices I have been blessed with.
